add
    - describe examples in R
    - bibliography
    - talk about what went wrong
        - classification of translations by determinant
            - this breaks when we complexify (and thus lose ordering)
            - line reflections are just point reflections with lambda = -1
        - x = y^2 lol
            - also breaks wuthout ordering
            - no geometric motivations 

edit heavily
    - abstract
    - intro to hyperbolic geometry


reorganize 
    - split ``what guggen did" into definitions/conventions 


check   
    - intro to poincare disk
    - notation

nits   
    - fix notation on examples in R
    - pg. 10 insert metric used
    - weird implication arrows pg. 15
