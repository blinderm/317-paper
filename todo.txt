add
    - describe examples in R [AB]
    - bibliography (list) [LG]
    - talk about what went wrong [AB]
        - classification of translations by determinant
            - this breaks when we complexify (and thus lose ordering)
            - line reflections are just point reflections with lambda = -1
        - x = y^2 lol
            - also breaks wuthout ordering
            - no geometric motivations 

edit heavily
    - abstract [Tuesday] 
    - intro to hyperbolic geometry [LG] 


reorganize 
    - split ``what guggen did" into definitions/conventions [AB Monday, LG Tuesday]


check   
    - intro to poincare disk [LG Tuesday?]
    - notation [LG Tuesday?]

nits   
    - fix notation on examples in R [LG]
    - pg. 10 insert metric used [LG]
    - weird implication arrows pg. 15 [LG] 
    - add code [??]
