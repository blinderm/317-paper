add
    - talk about what went wrong
        - classification of translations by determinant
            - this breaks when we complexify (and thus lose ordering)
        - x = y^2 lol
            - also breaks wuthout ordering
            - no geometric motivations 
    - say what complexifiation actually is... [LG]

edit heavily
	- examples in R section (includes all the stuff that went wrong) [AB]
    - abstract [both Tuesday] 
    - intro to hyperbolic geometry [LG] 
    - all the titles lol


check   
	- split ``what guggen did" into definitions/conventions [LG]
    - intro to poincare disk [LG Tuesday?]
    - notation [LG Tuesday?]

nits   
    - fix notation on examples in R [LG]
    - pg. 10 insert metric used [LG]
    - weird implication arrows pg. 15 [LG] 
    - add code [either?]
